# Webapplikation-boras

The final webbapplication is located under lab3/lab3 as a Netbeans Java EE project.

When downloaded or cloned, simply navigate into lab3/lab3, and open in your IDE of choice.

The structure inside the project consists of a webapp folder for all of our xhtml and css files. There is also a java folder which contain the model, view, controller, omdb and util folders.

Outside of this there exists a test folder for the tests of our model.

Within the first lab3 folder, there exists another folder named "Documents" which contain the report of the project.
